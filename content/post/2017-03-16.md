#### [Re: [scsi] scsi: ufs: don't check unsigned type for a negative value](https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org/msg59639.html)

Human error when a reviewer spells their own email wrong. Jokes are made but
all in good fun.

#### [Re: [RFC PATCH 00/13] Introduce first class virtual address spaces](https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-snps-arc@lists.infradead.org/msg02058.html)

Someone tries to reinvent the wheel, realizes most of the functionality can already
be achieved and sadly that their patch name is too "marketing".

#### [Re: [git pull] drm for v4.11 - main pull request](https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1339804.html)

The drm subsystem is on the shit list this week for making Linus go all caps
mode over nested defines & gcc warnings.

#### [Re: [PATCH net-next RFC v1 00/27] afnetns: new namespace type for separation on protocol level](https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg158118.html)

A new namespace is proposed to benefit container networking performance. This
just neat imho and there is no drama yet which is the actual shocker.

#### [Compiling kernels faster (was Re: v4.10: kernel stack frame pointer .. has bad value (null))](https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1350572.html)

A thread that started as a bug, turned into a compiler version debate, morphed into
a thread focusing on compiling kernels faster. Unsure if this can even be
considered a bike shed or if it needs a new name.
