### [[PATCH 00/24] Kernel lockdown](https://mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1370931.html)

This wins the "cool" award for this week. This patch set would provide
a mechanism to prevent user-space from modifying the running kernel image.

## [[PATCH 0/2] Create an initial user-space API manual](https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1368464.html)

As someone who is used to finding the specific commit messages in the kernel to
use as the "docs", this patch is YUGEEE.

### [[PATCH 0/3] LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Battery](https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1369222.html)

Blast from the past! We used to use LEGO Mindstorms in college, this patch is
for the driver for the battery.

### [[PATCH net-next 0/6] bpf: program testing framework](https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg160973.html)

Introduces a BPF testing framework, which solves numerous problems with skb and
xdp programs being difficult to test.

## [[PATCH v1 1/4] syscalls: Restore address limit after a syscall](https://mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1348508.html)

Prevents a syscall from modifying the address limit of the caller. Patch could
be used to mitigate [bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues#990](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=990).
